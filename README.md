# WAD?

WAD (which, according to the Doom Bible, is an acronym for "Where's All the Data?") is the file format used by Doom and all Doom-engine-based games for storing data. A WAD file consists of a header, a directory, and the data lumps that make up the resources stored within the file. IWAD The acronym IWAD is generally interpreted as "internal WAD"[1] and refers to a WAD file which contains all of the external data for a complete game. 

included IWADS
Data/RPG.WAD

pointers to these wad file are selected in Frames.HC and I use Ids.HC aswell.

## Text

RPG engine uses a simple text file for storing actor and dialog data because json is too complex. Actor.TXT and Dialog.TXT are the main ones. OPTIONS.TXT has the player modified options data saved there.

### Sprites??
 TempleOS sprites are stored in the `Sprites` Folder

# Maps
Levels are stored as matrix with each grid containing NodeStuff like Actors, objects and Items.

# Animation
Some animations are procedural but most are handled by the Director CQue which cycles through current tasks as needed. AddDirective and HasDirective are useful for timing new actions.

# AI
Coming soon

# Multiplayer 
coming soon
