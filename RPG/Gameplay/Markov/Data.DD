The fig ripens unseen until the sun remembers it; so too with a quiet mans fortune.
The well runs dry faster for those who boast of its depth.
The hand that hides its grain invites hunger before winters end.
The road teaches more than the teacher who has never walked it.
I will rise before the sun, for the lazy mans field feeds only crows.
I know the measure of a man by how he gives bread, not how he eats it.
I remember when the rains failed, and the proud bowed lower than the donkeys.
I speak softly to strangers, for angels once came to Abraham in the dust.
I trust the man who mends his sandals, not the one who counts anothers faults.
I have seen envy burn a hut faster than firewood.
I say truth travels slower than rumor, but it never loses its way.
I would rather lose a coin in kindness than find one in deceit.
I walk behind my ox, not before it; the furrow must follow, not lead.
I fear only the silence of God, not the noise of men.
You will reap what your tongue sows before your hands ever touch the earth.
You cannot hide a lie from your own sleep; it wakes you before the rooster.
You walk as your father taught, even if your feet deny it.
You think the rich mans door is open, but his heart is not.
You give salt to a neighbor, he will lend you his fire when winter comes.
You carry your anger like a jar with cracks; it spills before reaching home.
You should mend the roof when the stars are kind, not when the storm shouts.
You may boast of your sheep, but count them after the wolf leaves.

That man is rich who owes nothing but kindness.
That word you swallow today may save your teeth tomorrow.
That path of stones leads to peace if walked with humility.
That stranger at your gate might carry your blessing or your test.
That cup of cold water may cool more than thirst.
That seed buried in doubt will never see the sun.
That day will come when the liar forgets his lie but not its cost.
That hand you slap may one day feed your son.
That silence after anger is the beginning of wisdom.
And when the sun burns hottest, remember the shadow it casts is your rest.
And if your brother falls, lift him before asking why he stumbled.
And though the road is long, the dust remembers your patience.
And when all words fail, let your work speak.
And if you lend, lend without counting, or it is not mercy.
And when your field is full, leave a corner for the hungry.

The stone remembers every foot that stepped on it, though none remember the stone.
The child who listens learns faster than the man who argues.
The sparrow eats what it finds, not what it dreams.
The old jar holds the sweetest wine.
The ear that hears correction is richer than the hand that holds gold.
The market is loud, but truth whispers by the well.

The eyes of the hungry see more than the full mans wisdom.
The shepherd counts by love, not by number.
The mouth that curses rain shall thirst longest.
The fig tree blooms for the patient alone.
The wind that bends the grass spares the tree that bows.
I saw men fight over dust and lose their peace for nothing.
I trade my rest for bread, but not my honor for coin.
I keep silent when the wise speak, for echoing wisdom is better than inventing folly.
I would rather break my back than my word.
I tell my sons: a slow step lasts longer than a loud boast.

I hear the voice of truth most clearly when my stomach is empty.
I plant though the locust flew last year.
I lend a hand to those who cursed me, and my sleep is still sweet.
I learned that mercy grows faster than barley in wet soil.

I have found that silence is the only honest answer to pride.
I return good for evil not because they deserve it, but because I do.
I keep my tongue as I keep my ox—well bridled and seldom driven.
You judge a man not by his robe but by his shadow in the sun.
You build walls with words when silence would have kept peace.
You think the drought is cruel; the proud think the same of patience.
You will find no blessing in bread gained by deceit.

And when night grows cold, be the fire for another.
And if your field fails, your hands still hold prayer.
And though friends fade, mercy never withers.
And if anger visits, do not let it stay the night.
And when your heart is full, empty your jar for the thirsty.
And if laughter leaves your house, sing until it returns.
And when the child cries, the village is tested.
And if your tongue burns, your truth was too sharp.

Do not hide kindness; it shines brighter in famine.
Do trust the one who prays before speaking.
Do not step over a hungry man to reach a feast.
Do mend your heart as carefully as your roof.
That tree near the well taught me stillness before shade.
That man who listens to rebuke saves his field from ruin.
That morning when the rain fell, the land forgave our pride.
That coin given in secret weighs nothing on the soul.

And when you reap, leave some grain for the forgotten.
And if your ox grows weary, rest it before it breaks.
And though the sky darkens, remember the stars still wait.
And when your heart hardens, water it with compassion.
And if the road splits, take the one that humbles you.
And when the well is deep, lower your pride first.
And if your lamp burns low, lend it air, not complaint.
And when friends quarrel, be the quiet between them.
And though age bends your back, let it not bend your mercy.
And when you die, leave no debt but love.
The man who boasts of strength has not yet carried grief.
The olive tree bends and lives; the cedar breaks and is proud.
The lamp that burns through the night teaches patience to the watcher.
The dog that guards for bread will bark for anyone with a crust.
I walk slower now, but my peace walks with me.
I give thanks for small mercies; they teach larger ones to come.
I have no gold, but I have time for those who knock.
I wait for answers only after I have tilled my field.
You will forget insults faster than hunger, so feed the poor before arguing.
You cannot bless and curse from the same mouth.
You will find truth where no one is shouting.
You should listen to the quiet man at the gate; he has seen more than priests.
Do not count your cattle while the wolves still howl.
Do speak softly when truth is heavy.
Do not chase anothers path and expect your own blessing.
Do what good you can before sunset, for dawn is not promised.
That dust on your sandals is holier than the palace floor.
That promise whispered is louder in heaven than a vow shouted.
That poor mans prayer is a seed that never dies.
That word of comfort can mend more than a coin can buy.
And when you are wronged, plant mercy, not memory.
And if laughter visits, open the door wide.
And when your hands are empty, lift them higher.
And though the season turns, goodness never goes out of fashion.
