Wake, wanderer. You dream on sacred ground.
Do you not smell the musk of the pack?
The den is not yours to share, fool.
The she-wolf stirs her patience thins.
You lie where pups are born. Rise.
The grove whispers its disapproval.
Even the moss recoils from your scent.
Did the town not warn you about the wolves?
Their ground is bound by moonlight and oath.
Your fire frightened the younglings.
Sleep elsewhere before the Circle hears of this.
I should let the pack teach you manners.
The wolves are my kin you trespass on family.
Natures teeth are sharp for the careless.
Move before the dusk finds you here.
The den is older than your kind. Show respect.
This soil drinks only the blood of hunters, not guests.
If you value your limbs, stand up now.
The pack has been restless since your arrival.
The air here belongs to fur and fang, not man.
I guard this place, and I am less forgiving than they.
Take your dreams to the inn, not the den.
Even the moon frowns on your arrogance.
The grove remembers every trespass.
You sleep beneath a vow older than your oaths.
Your snoring sounds like challenge and they listen.
I will not ask again. Leave this ground.
Why do you sleep near the wolves den, fool of flesh and ignorance?
What madness brings you to rest where the pack feeds?
Why choose the wolves den as your bed, when safer ground lies a stones throw away?
Do you fancy yourself part of the pack, or just their next meal?
Why make your bed beneath their breath, stranger?
Do you not sense the life pulsing under that soil?
Why rest beside the wolves when even the wind avoids this place?
What draws you here, arrogance, or blindness?
Why do you sleep at their threshold, as if begging for teeth?
Has no one told you whose den this is?
Why rest your head where pups learn to hunt?
Do you seek to test the Circles patience, or the wolves?
Why make camp where the howl begins?
What spirit whispered this foolishness into your dreams?
Why do you slumber so close to wild blood?
Do you mistake this den for a friendly hearth?
Why do you sleep near the wolves den, as if the world were empty of warning?
Who taught you to trespass and call it rest?
Why lie beneath their moon when you are not of their kin?
Why sleep among wolves, when men built you beds in town?
Do you seek to be bitten, or blessed?
Why here, of all places in this wide land?
Do you know what wakes when a man sleeps by the wolves den?  
Why do you sleep here, as if their growls were lullabies?  
Even the roots whisper, asking why you chose this cursed patch of earth.  
Why do you sleep near the wolves den?  
Why would anyone make camp beside a den full of wolves?  
Do you even know what lives under that hill?  
Why did you think this was a safe place to rest?  
What made you lie down so close to the pack?  
Why are you sleeping here of all places?  
You saw the claw marks and thought it was fine.  
Why are you curled up next to a den that smells like danger?  
Do you have a death wish or just no sense?  
Why pick the wolves doorstep for a nap?  
You are sleeping where the pack feeds.  
Why not move a few steps away from the wolves?  
What made you think the wolves would welcome company?  
Why are you resting where pups are raised?  
Do you really not hear them breathing under the dirt?  
Why do you sleep where the wolves rule the ground?  
This is no place for travelers to rest.  
Why lie here when the inn is half a mile away?  
Do you not feel the eyes watching from the den?  
Why did you choose the wolves den as your bed tonight?  
Why are you sleeping near the wolves den again?  
Do you have no sense at all?  
You saw the warning stones and still set up camp here.  
Are you trying to get yourself eaten or just testing me?  
How many times do I have to tell people not to sleep by the den?  
Do you think the wolves will just ignore you?  
What part of wolves den looks like a campsite to you?  
I swear every traveler thinks they can nap anywhere.  
You really thought this was a good idea.  
You could sleep anywhere else and you pick the one place full of wolves.  
Do you enjoy waking up surrounded by teeth?  
You smell like fear and the wolves can tell.  
Do you think I enjoy dragging fools out of dens at dawn?  
Why would you ever think this spot was safe?  
You saw the bones and thought it looked cozy.  
You are testing the patience of the entire grove.  
How hard is it to find a field without fangs in it?  
I should just let the wolves handle this lesson.  
Do you even listen when people warn you?  
You are lucky I found you before the pack did.  
I have better things to do than scold sleepers in wolf territory.  
Honestly, how do you survive traveling like this?  
You are breathing wolf air and wondering why they growl.  
If you wanted trouble, congratulations, you found it.  
This is not bravery, it is stupidity.  
Do you ever think before you sleep?  
You pick the worst places every time.  
Why are you always near something that wants to eat you?  
Do you like testing the balance of nature?  
You really think the wolves will make an exception for you?  
You reek of iron and sweat; they hate that.  
The pack can smell your fear from here.  
Why are you snoring where predators rest?  
Even the grass is warning you to leave.  
You are lucky the wolves are patient tonight.  
You call this camping; I call it foolishness.  
Did you miss the bones scattered around?  
You could have picked a hill or a barn, but no.  
Why do you always find the most dangerous corner of town?  
Are you trying to prove something to yourself?  
I cannot keep rescuing idiots from the den.  
The pack was circling before I even saw you.  
Do you know how close you are to being bitten?  
You are trespassing in more ways than one.  
The wolves are not fond of guests.  
You keep testing the grove like it owes you safety.  
Even the wind avoids this place at night.  
You are sleeping on sacred ground, not a patch of dirt.  
The Circle will hear of this.  
You really enjoy tempting fate, dont you?  
That smell on your boots is blood; no wonder they growl.  
I warned you yesterday, and yet here you are again.  
Do you enjoy giving me headaches?  
The wolves are the least of your worries here.  
The ground itself hums when you breathe on it.  
You think the grove will forgive this trespass?  
This is not bravery; it is pure nonsense.  
I can hear the wolves waking already.  
How many times must you learn the same lesson?  
You are disturbing the balance of this place.  
You have no right to sleep here.  
The den has rules older than you will ever understand.  
You bring chaos wherever you lay your head.  
You are not part of the pack; stop acting like it.  
You make more noise than a thunderstorm.  
Even the moss shivers under your weight.
The forest gives warnings in whispers; only fools wait for shouts.  
Every den has teeth behind its silence.  
A wolf defends its den as the earth defends its roots.  
Those who forget the wild remember it in pain.  
The grove does not forgive those who tread without thought.  
Respect is the fence between peace and blood.  
Even the kindest beast bites when cornered.  
Nature teaches best with claws.  
A wise traveler asks before resting; a fool assumes.  
The roots remember every trespass.  
Do not build comfort where danger sleeps.  
Where the moonlight stops, the law of men ends.  
You cannot tame the wild by ignoring it.  
A den is not a door to knock on, it is a warning to turn away.  
The forest watches what men forget.  
When you breathe without listening, the land grows tired of you.  
Peace with nature is not granted; it is earned.  
The wolf’s patience is shorter than your dream.  
Every howl has a reason; you just do not hear it yet.  
The ground you disturb will one day disturb you.  
Nature has no interest in excuses.  
The wise do not sleep where eyes are watching.  
A calm forest is a trick of the wind.  
You call it wilderness; I call it home.  
Those who mock the wild do not return to tell the tale.  
Even a stone knows when to move out of the way.  
The forest gives lessons to the living and the dead.  
Balance is not gentle, only fair.  
To take without asking is to invite the storm.  
You do not own the path you walk.  
The wolf owes you nothing but truth.  
Those who ignore growls wake up missing parts.  
Every grove has laws older than kings.  
Sleep is trust; choose where you place it carefully.  
If you cannot listen to the wind, you cannot stay here.  
The forest does not care for your comfort.  
Nature measures respect in silence, not words.  
When the wild goes quiet, it is deciding your fate.  
The pack moves for need, not for your convenience.  
A den is sacred because life begins there.  
You disturb what you do not understand.  
The patient wolf is still a hunter.  
Every trespass echoes, even through moss.  
The forest hides nothing from those who listen.  
You are not the first fool to confuse calm for safety.  
The land remembers kindness and folly alike.  
Even fire bows to the will of rain.  
You cannot earn peace while ignoring warnings.  
When you lie on sacred ground, you lie to yourself.  
A wolf does not snarl for fun.  
Every root you step on knows your weight.  
To rest without asking is to steal from the earth.  
The wind carries the stories of those who did not listen.  
Nature does not punish; it balances.  
The pack teaches what words cannot.  
The den is not danger; you are.  
Fools fear beasts; the wise fear imbalance.  
The wild gives you shelter until you forget it is a gift.  
Every path is watched, even the ones you think are secret.  
You sleep among wolves and wonder why you wake to growls.  
Harmony is a trade, not a trophy.  
The grove does not shout; it simply acts.  
A wolf’s mercy lasts one heartbeat.  
Every howl is an answer to something you broke.  
The old ways never die; they wait.  
When the moon rises, the forest judges all.  
Your scent tells the story of your respect.  
The wild speaks, but pride plugs your ears.  
Even a leaf knows when it has fallen too far.  
A den unguarded is a world gone wrong.  
Peace with wolves is peace with yourself.  
You cannot command what you never served.  
Every mistake leaves a mark on the soil.  
The forest is patient, but never forgiving.  
A true druid asks the land before stepping on it.  
You seek rest; the wolves seek order.  
A fool calls it superstition; the wise call it survival.  
You are the intruder, not the wolves.  
Every den teaches a lesson in boundaries.  
When you stop fearing the wild, you start losing to it.  
The grove needs no witness to pass judgment.  
You cannot silence the forest by closing your eyes.  
Every creature keeps its promise to nature but man.  
The wolves defend what men forget to protect.  
The moon sees all your mistakes and forgives none.  
Even the dirt beneath you has opinions.  
Respect the circle, or it will close around you.  
A den is a prayer, not a shelter.  
You cannot rest in peace if you do not rest in respect.  
Every howl tonight carries your name.  
The wild is older than your courage.  
If you wish to live among beasts, learn to listen.  
Balance does not beg to be kept.  
The grove rewards humility with mercy.  
The wolves guard balance, not territory.  
You may think yourself brave; the forest calls it foolish.  
A lesson ignored becomes a wound.  
Every trespass feeds the hunger of the wild.  
The pack remembers what men forget.  
The forest does not hate you; it corrects you.  
The world was not made for your comfort, traveler.
