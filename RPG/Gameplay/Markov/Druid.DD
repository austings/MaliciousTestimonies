The meat in your pack apologizes on your behalf to their elders.
The cedar bough you chose as a pillow smells like permission to predators.
The stream you camp beside is the same path their paws already know.
The fire you trust is a timid fox pretending to be a lion.
The dew at dawn will wash the blood clean, if you are unlucky.

The night does not bargain when children in gray cloaks need practice.
The cold makes your breath a banner, and banners invite sieges.
The pack shares news faster than your feet can find second thoughts.
