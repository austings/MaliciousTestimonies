Pass the wine jar, friend.  
The figs are sweet this season.  
Sit closer to the lamp before it goes out.  
Is that new linen from Tyre?  
You have poured too much, but I will not refuse.  
The bread is warm, praise the oven keeper.  
Did you hear the lyre player from the north hills?  
Pour another cup and let us forget the taxes.  
This oil smells like cedar and honey.  
Your sandals look fit for a priest.  
Who brought the pomegranate wine?  
I swear this goat stew could make a soldier weep.  
Do not spill the lentils again, cousin.  
The stars are bright tonight; someone bless the host.  
Let the children dance before the fire goes low.  
Is that harp tuned or possessed?  
The olives taste of rain this year.  
Tell me again how you bartered for those earrings.  
The bread cracked like thunderâ€”well baked.  
Do not sit there; that mat belongs to the elder.  
More dates? They melt in the mouth like mercy.  
How long has the jar been open? I can smell Babylon.  
Your robe catches every drop of wine, careful.  
The flute player has lost his rhythm again.  
Someone call for more oil before the lamp dies.  
Do you still trade with the caravans from Aram?  
Your laughter wakes the goats outside.  
Is that salt or sand in the stew?  
The cup has gone missing again, pass mine.  
You always sing louder after the second jug.  
Did you see the merchants arguing at the gate today?  
Pour for her first, she told the best story.  
The honey cakes are almost gone; guard them well.  
Tell us a tale from your last journey to the coast.  
Your brother still owes me two measures of barley.  
The old man by the door has fallen asleep again.  
Do not boast, your vineyard barely survived the locusts.  
The harp strings sound like wind in the valley.  
Drink, guest, and speak of peace while we have it.  
The figs stick to my teeth but I forgive them.  
Who carved that cup? It feels smooth as dawn.  
Pass the jug left; right is unlucky tonight.  
The smoke curls like a prophets dream.  
Your cloak smells of cedar wood and travel.  
I heard laughter even from the servants court.  
May the wine last longer than our stories.  
Do you remember the feast before the exile?  
My cousin swore he saw a lion near the spring.  
The bread burns fast on this fire, keep turning it.  
Is that music or a prayer? I cannot tell.  
Sit, guest, and rest your feet; the night is still young.  
The figs taste better with a bit of salt.  
You speak as if you have not slept in days.  
Who invited the potter? He dances like a reed in wind.  
The stew thickens, someone fetch more water.  
Do not feed the catfish bones to the dog.  
The jug feels lighter every time you pass it.  
Sing the song of the harvest, the one from Samaria.  
My cousin always claps on the wrong beat.  
The clay cups chip but hold the wine just fine.  
Your story grows longer each time you tell it.  
I have never seen a priest laugh that hard.  
Even the guards outside are humming the tune.  
The lamps smoke too much; open the window a crack.  
I can smell the sea on your cloak still.  
That flute is older than my fathers oath.  
You spill more wine than you drink, friend.  
Tell us again about the storm at sea.  
The grapes came early this year, sweet and heavy.  
Do not touch the platter; it is for the elders.  
The bread man burned his hand again, poor soul.  
You laugh like a man who has seen too much sun.  
That song brings back the hills of home.  
Pass the bowl before it cools, I beg you.  
Even the dogs are quiet tonight.  
You speak of Babylon as if it were a dream.  
The figs and nuts together taste like festival.  
You always steal the last olive.  
My robe was clean before this meal began.  
The cup cracks, but the wine stays true.  
You pour like a man racing time itself.  
The hosts wife has a better voice than any bard.  
I have not eaten this well since the new moon feast.  
Pass the bread before the children take it all.  
The lamp smoke stings, but it feels like home.  
You sing off key, and I love it anyway.  
The stew has cooled; let us toast before dawn.  
Tell us what dreams you brought from the desert.  
Do not fall asleep in the courtyard again.  
The night smells of figs and fire.  
Even the stars seem drunk tonight.  
You laugh like someone who survived too much.  
The bread breaks easy; that means good fortune.  
Pour the last drop; the dawn is near.  
No feast lasts forever, but this one tries.  
The jug is empty, and so are our worries.  
Let the music play until the lamps go out.  
May this night outlast our sorrows.  
The earth feels soft, the fire warm, the company right.  
Fill my cup again, it is a wedding after all.  
The bride shines brighter than the lamp flames.  
Who knew the groom could dance like that.  
Pour faster, the night will not wait.  
Even the figs are drunk tonight.  
The harp player has lost count but not spirit.  
Someone kiss the groom before he falls over.  
The bread tastes of joy and smoke.  
I spilled the wine but the earth was thirsty.  
The air smells like honey and laughter.  
My cousin is dancing with a jar on his head again.  
Do not stop the song, the stars are still awake.  
The wine jar looks smaller every time I see it.  
Bless the couple and whoever made this stew.  
My feet forgot how to walk but they still dance.  
You call that singing, I call it victory noise.  
Pass the bowl before someone drinks it dry.  
The brides veil glows like moonlight on water.  
I could marry this wine if it asked nicely.  
No one leaves until the jar is empty.  
The goat stole the bread again, let it celebrate too.  
My head spins like a chariot wheel, and I love it.  
The grooms mother is dancing with the potter.  
This wine tastes older than Babylon.  
Raise your cups, even if they are cracked.  
The lyre is missing a string, but who cares.  
You can bless the hands that poured this joy.  
The figs are gone, so are my worries.  
Someone tell the groom he is still wearing the wreath.  
I laughed so hard I woke the chickens.  
If the wine keeps flowing, so will my blessings.  
The brides father is crying again, give him more wine.  
My robe has seen too many spills to care.  
The harp hums like the night itself.  
You call that a dance step, I call it courage.  
My sandals left the floor hours ago.  
Even the guards outside are tapping their feet.  
The groom just promised the moon to everyone.  
The cup is heavy, but so is my heart with joy.  
I have never seen so much laughter in one courtyard.  
If I fall, pour wine on me and call it a blessing.  
The stew tastes better when you are swaying.  
This wedding will be talked about for generations.  
Someone fetch more oil before the lamps join the bride.  
You sing like a dove in the rain.  
Every song tonight becomes a promise.  
The air itself smells married.  
I danced with three strangers and loved them all.  
The groom is red as pomegranate wine.  
Even the children are staggering with laughter.  
Pass the jug before it sobers up.  
The drummer fell, but the rhythm stayed.  
This is the kind of night prophets envy.  
I forgot my name but not the chorus.  
Pour for me, my cup is jealous of yours.  
No feast ends before dawn, not this one.  
The moon is our witness and the wine our friend.  
My feet are tired but my heart still dances.  
The bride laughed so loud the lamp flickered.  
The grooms cousin is asleep under the table.  
Someone sing the song of first love again.  
I never knew bread could taste like music.  
We have turned the night into a festival of hearts.  
This wine talks more sense than any elder.  
Even the olives are clapping.  
I swear the moon winked at the bride.  
No one pours as bravely as the best man.  
You look like a god under torchlight.  
The potter broke a cup and everyone cheered.  
If this is sin, I will sin again tomorrow.  
The brides hair smells like fig blossoms.  
The grooms laugh could wake the dead.  
Keep singing, I almost remember the words.  
The stew is gone, so we drink instead.  
Someone give the goat a cup; it earned it.  
My voice cracked but my joy did not.  
The lamps sway like they are dancing too.  
You can taste the sea in this wine.  
The floor feels like a boat and I am sailing.  
Even the elders are clapping their hands.  
The jug is lighter than my heart tonight.  
No one argues on a night like this.  
Every laugh sounds like a blessing.  
The brides mother has claimed the dance floor.  
I would trade a week of sleep for another song.  
The fire burns low but spirits burn high.  
Pour the last cup, then fill it again.  
The night is drunk and so are we.  
The groom swore the stars were clapping.  
The music stumbles but the hearts do not.  
Even the walls are humming with joy.  
You fetch more figs before I start singing.  
The harp hums like a prayer in the wind.  
We drink to love, to peace, to forgetting the taxes.  
My cup is never empty, and neither is my smile.  
Let the dawn wait outside, we are still celebrating.  
You dance like lightning dressed as laughter.  
The brides smile could outshine the sun.  
The wine has won and I surrender gladly.  
The feast ends when the last song forgets itself.  
Raise the cups, shout the names, love the night.  
May this joy live longer than any of us.  
The grooms uncle fell again, someone help him up.  
The night itself is drunk with happiness.
