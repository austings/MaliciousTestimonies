The wine jar, will you pass it before it empties itself again.
The figs are sweeter than memory, and softer than yesterday's sorrow.
The bread smells of comfort, baked with laughter and olive oil.
The groom's eyes follow the bride as if she were sunrise.
The music trembles through the ground like joy finding its footing.
The guests clap off rhythm but with honest hearts.
The jug tips faster than my hand can keep up.
The lamb is tender, the company better.
The bride's veil catches the candlelight like dawn caught in linen.
The air smells of roast and spilled honey.
The old men argue softly about whose vineyard sent the best wine.
The children chase figs and blessings between tables.

The olive oil shines on every dish like gold in sunlight.
The well behind the house will remember this night by its echoes.
The harp player grins as though every note were a secret.
The women whisper like doves trading news of the groom.
The cousin from the coast brags about Tyrian linen again.

The stew smells like patience and old family recipes.
The pot cracks slightly but holds until the end of blessing.
The roof beams hum softly from stamping feet.
The floor remembers every wedding, and still welcomes this one.
The night breeze mixes laughter and rosemary.
The lamps sway in agreement with the rhythm.
The groom's uncle tells the same story, and it grows with each retelling.
The mother of the bride hides tears in her smile.
The cousin sings louder than talent requires, but the crowd forgives him.
The field outside glows with moonlight and discarded sandals.
The laughter grows when the first jar falls.
The smell of lentils reminds me of home.
The bride's hair shines brighter than the oil lamps.
The groom looks at her as if no other song exists.
The bread soaks the stew, and both taste of celebration.
The dogs wait patiently for theology to end and crumbs to begin.
The little boy steals dates and gets caught by everyone.
The old women bless the couple until language gives out.
The wind through the palm leaves adds its own applause.
The pomegranate seeds scatter like promises across the table.
The tablecloth stains will become tomorrow's stories.
The clay cups knock together like friendly disputes.
The youngest sister hides behind the bride's train and dreams aloud.
The musicians exchange glances that say play louder or be forgotten.
The moon climbs above the courtyard and sees nothing worth correcting.
The feast lasts longer than the gossip.
I taste joy stronger than wine tonight.
I will dance even if my feet remember the plow tomorrow.
I cannot count how many blessings fit into one meal.
I tell you, friendship grows faster than vines under this roof.
I find peace in full plates and empty arguments.
I will raise my cup until the stars answer.
I remember weddings where laughter cost more effort.
I thank God for music that forgets sorrow.
I see the bride's joy and forget the year's drought.
I never refuse a dance when the drum insists.
I watch the groom's mother and see pride older than speech.
I taste thyme and honey and every story my grandmother told.
I hold this cup steady so the joy does not spill.
I promise to remember this warmth when winter comes.
I hear laughter echo from the hills like answered prayer.
I sit near the fire because wisdom gathers where stories burn.
I share bread because the heart widens when the mouth is full.
I recall my own wedding when figs were fewer but love was plenty.
I hope the couple learns to argue softly and forgive quickly.
I raise my cup again because reasons are many and wine is good.
I cannot decide if the song or the smile is sweeter.
I wonder if angels envy mortal celebrations.
I will sing until my voice frays like old linen.
I give thanks for neighbors who forget debts during feasts.
I listen for the drum even between breaths.
I believe the laughter keeps the walls from crumbling.
I smell roasted goat and humility in equal measure.
I find mercy in the taste of shared salt.
I feel younger when the flutes begin.
I nod to strangers and they nod back with wine on their lips.
I hold the child so her mother can dance again.
I learn that joy multiplies when poured.
I will not speak of sorrow tonight.
I watch the torches bow to the wind like servants of joy.
I pour more wine to keep silence from entering.
I whisper a prayer for long years and loud laughter.
I thank the bride for reminding us that love outshines age.
I think the bread is holier when broken among friends.
I know the world is safe when music drowns complaint.

I will remember the glow of faces more than the taste of food.
I find contentment in the noise of family.
I sit with elders who nod approval between bites.
I think peace feels like this: full bellies and empty grudges.
I forget hunger while the drum plays.
You should taste the bread before it cools.

You cheer louder than the drummers; keep it that way.
You will lose your voice before dawn, and it will be worth it.
You smell of bread and joy; keep standing near me.
You greet every guest as if you own the feast.
You bring light wherever the lamps fade.
You tell jokes that feed laughter like bread feeds hunger.
You will wake sore and smiling, I promise.
You make the old songs sound young again.
You should slow your cup or speed your dance, not both.

You raise your cup like a prophet of pleasure.
You look blessed by both sun and vineyard.
You hum louder than the harp, and no one minds.

You stand where the drum sounds thickest; clever choice.
You call the night short but joy will not allow sleep.
You grin as if you helped build the stars.
You must eat before you bless again.
You will forget sorrow if you dance long enough.
You speak truth softer after wine; keep that gift.
You pour faith into your cup each time it empties.
You teach the children rhythm faster than elders can correct it.
You glow with torchlight and contentment.
You laugh so loud that neighbors believe the wedding is theirs.
You fill the night with reasons to remember.
You walk like someone who trusts tomorrow to be kind.

Do take another olive; moderation is for mourners.
Do teach your children this dance; it holds more faith than sermons.
Do speak kindly; every word tonight is heard twice by heaven.

Do carry the bride's laughter in your pocket for luck.
Do walk home slowly; the moon deserves company.
Do promise to return next feast; joy needs repetition.
That bread still steams; patience will only cool it.
That wine has seen more stories than I can remember.
That song sounds like it borrowed wings from sparrows.
That bride wears contentment better than linen.
That groom will lose his voice before midnight.
That laughter came from the elders, a miracle itself.
That platter will never return empty.
That smell of mint and lamb could convert anyone.
That child sleeps beside the harp, safest place here.
That torch leans like it listens to gossip.
That old man tells his youth again, louder each retelling.

That toast should be remembered longer than debts.
That goat at the gate wishes it were invited.
That last jug will test friendships and balance.
That singer knows every verse of happiness.
That cousin lost his sandal again.
That plate of dates vanished faster than advice.
That laughter proves the covenant is already fruitful.
That soft flute note feels like mercy walking.
That friend of the groom is clearly in love with song.
That promise spoken under the stars will hold.
That moonbeam on the wine looks like blessing.
That dance step was borrowed from angels.
That guest fell asleep smiling; let him rest.
That night wind carries joy to distant fields.
That mother hums to the baby louder than the harp.
That pomegranate stain looks like good fortune.
That bench creaks in agreement with our cheer.
And when the drum stops, someone will still hum.
And if joy had weight, the roof would bow tonight.
And when the jug empties, hearts will still overflow.
And if you must cry, let it be from laughter.
And when dawn comes, it will envy our light.
And if silence falls, fill it with another story.
And when children wake, tell them joy visited.
And if bread remains, send it to neighbors with blessing.
And when torches fade, memory will burn longer.
And if rain falls, call it another gift.
And when songs end, friendship will keep rhythm.
And if the moon leaves, the stars will attend instead.
And when the feast is over, gratitude begins.
And if I forget this night, remind me with a fig.
And when hearts grow heavy again, recall this table.
And if love falters, wine will remember its taste.
And when the last dancer rests, the earth will hum softly.
And if quarrels return, invite them to supper and watch them starve.
And when the groom speaks tomorrow, may his voice still carry laughter.
And if sorrow knocks, feed it before sending it away kindly.
And when blessings are counted, let no one stop early.
And if joy spills, do not clean it too quickly.
And when guests part, may roads remember their feet.
And if God watches, may He smile at our disorder.
And when we meet again, let it be with music still in our steps.
